This is an attempt to port the Language Tool Spelling and Grammar Check to TinyMCE4. It also does things like highlighting as you type and etc.

Currently the code is is EXPIREMENTAL. Use at your own risk. The code is also very messy, stuck in debug mode and does not take any parameters. And it does not allow for clean source or copy and paste viewing.

It is also currently set to process requests when you are on a new line and once every 10 seconds via the public Language Tool site.

There is a few concepts that I am exploring here from making it work:

1 - As you type functionality
2 - Only check for changes

The plugin already works, but I only tested it for 10 minutes of typing and trying things out. This repository exists to mostly track bugs and etc.

Once I am done coding the basic stuff, I'll clean up the code and make it more presentable. Hopefully sometime this week or the next.


Options:

lt_url = The url of the LanguageTool installation. (Defaults to public server)

lt_timer = Sets the timeout to process spelling and grammar in milliseconds (Defaults to 10000 which equals 10 seconds) DO NOT LOWER THIS UNLESS YOU USE YOUR OWN INSTALLATION

lt_lang = Sets the language (Defaults to en-US)

lt_highlight = Object that sets the classes for the highlighting [It is best to edit the CSS instead of touching this]
